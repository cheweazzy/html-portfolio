<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hey there! I'm Nazar, a third-year university student diving deep into the world of web development. Originally hailing from Ukraine, I've set my sights on learning and growing in Poland. When I'm not crafting code, you'll catch me dribbling on the basketball court, enjoying every moment in an amateur league game. But my interests don't stop there; I have a profound love for electronics, diving into repairs and modifications, exploring the intricate world beyond the screen. I'm all about merging tech prowess with a passion for sports, striving to make my mark in both realms. Join me on this journey of tech, hoops, and endless curiosity!
